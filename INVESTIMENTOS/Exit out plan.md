Tactical 2–3 Month Exit Plan (BTC & ETH Rotation)

## Step 1: Immediate Actions (Now — BTC Intermediate Risk)

Sell 15–20% of BTC into USDT ASAP to start building your cash buffer.

Keep your remaining BTC fully intact for now.

Hold ETH as is, watching ETH/BTC closely.



---

## Step 2: ETH Rotation Monitoring (Next 2–4 weeks)

Watch for ETH/BTC to break and hold above major resistance (e.g., 200-day MA or a clear trendline).

Confirm ETH daily gains outpace BTC for multiple days.

Keep ETH bag untouched until this confirmation.



---

## Step 3: ETH Peak & Flip (Within 4–6 weeks)

When ETH/BTC hits a key target zone (set based on recent swing highs, e.g., ~0.08–0.1 BTC) and starts showing bearish reversal signs (RSI > 70 + price stalling/reversal), flip your entire ETH holding back into BTC.

This increases BTC exposure with no fiat risk.



---

## Step 4: Aggressive BTC De-Risking (Over next 4–8 weeks)

As BTC approaches upper log regression band or shows exhaustion signs (high RSI, decreasing volume, rising BTC.D), start selling BTC in chunks of 10–15% every 1–2 weeks.

Use technical triggers like:

Daily RSI > 80

BTC candle closes below short-term EMA (e.g., 20-day) after hitting peak

BTC dominance topping or parabolic moves slowing down




---

## Step 5: Post-Top Quick Exit (If BTC drops >10% from peak)

If BTC drops 10%+ after your peak, sell any remaining active BTC exposure down to your long-term cold storage allocation.

Keep some BTC cold stored for multi-cycle holding, but be mostly in USDT/stablecoins for safety.

Additional Tips

Use alerts on ETH/BTC RSI and price levels to catch rotation flips quickly.

Consider partial fills to avoid slippage if market is volatile.

Avoid chasing if ETH/BTC breaks out strongly — wait for pullbacks before flipping back to BTC.

Keep a mental or spreadsheet tracker of your sells to avoid emotional doubling down or panic selling.
